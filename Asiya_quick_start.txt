============================

The size of the complete sources of the Asiya toolkit is 25GB (this includes the core, the resources, language models, source code of external tools, parsers, etc.).  However, it is not required to download nor install all the resources and tools in order to have a light version of Asiya up and running. This guide addresses this issue and gives the instructions to have a light version of Asiya that uses the minimun resources. 


1. INTRODUCTION
================

The core of Asiya is a Perl program that 1) processes a testbed, 2) calculates the scores and 3) saves the results in XML files.Having the basics of Asiya up and running requires just a machine having Perl installed and several additional libraries that can be easily installed using CPAN (see the manual for the list of libraries). 

Then, Asiya uses a large set of additional resources and tools to calculate the MT evaluation scores. Some of these resources are language-dependend (e.g., parsers and language models) and require other system resources (e.g., Java VM), to compile sources (e.g., C++ programms) and the installation of other programms (e.g., SRILM). 

Most of the language-independent measures are calculated with no or little additional resources (namely, lexical metrics and n-gram characterizations). 
In this guide we explain how to set up Asiya to run using minimal resources. This allows to calculte the following measures: 


2. CONTENTS OF ASIYA SOURCES
==============================

The sources of the Asiya toolkit are organized as follows:

- Asiya
    |
    |- bin  		-- (contains the main Asiya programm) 
        |
        - Asiya.pl
    |
    |- doc 			-- (contains the Asiya technical manual)
    	  | 
    	  - Asiya_technical_manual.pdf
    |
    |- lib        -- (contains the Asiya programm libraries)
    |
    |- sample     -- (contains sample data)
    |
    |- scripts    -- (contains useful scripts)
    |
    |- tools 		-- (contains the external resources used by Asiya)
    |
    - ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS    
    - HISTORY  
    - LGPL.txt    
    - Makefile.PL  
    - README    
    - TODO
    


3. CHECKOUT FROM SVN THE REQUIRED SOURCE CODE ONLY 
===================================================

a) The mandatory folders are: 

- Asiya/bin
- Asiya/lib
- Asiya/tools/tokenizer        

  These two allows already for calculating the Ol, Rl, Pl and Fl measures (lexical overlap, recall, precision and F1) 


b) Then, it is recomended to checkout also the following tools that are also Perl programms:

- Asiya/tools/gtm-1.4
- Asiya/tools/mteval-kit	
- Asiya/tools/wer
- Asiya/tools/rouge-1.5.5 

  These allow for calculating GTM, BLEU, NIST, WER and ROUGE metrics


c) The following measures are also recommended. They allow for calculating PER, LeM and NGRAM measures and require only a JVM (Java) running in the machine. They do not need to be recompiled nor additional installations. The folders you need to checkout are: 

- Asiya/tools/per
- Asiya/tools/lengthmodel  

  

d) Finally, TER and METEOR are also well-known metrics that are highly recommeded since they tend to result in good performance. They require WordNet installed and having the system variables correctly set up. The folders that you need to check out are: 
   
- Asiya/tools/terp.v1          
- Asiya/tools/meteor-1.4  


4. UPDATE YOUR PERL INSTALLATION
=================================

To run Asiya you will need to extend your Perl system with the last version of the following libraries. An easy way to do it is by means of the cpan tool: $ cpan -install Modern::Perl 

– XML::Twig
– XML::DOM 
– XML::Parser
– XML::RegExp
- Benchmark 
- Modern::Perl 
- Getopt::Long 
- Data::Dumper 
- Data::UUID 
- IO::File 
- Modern::Perl 
- POSIX 
- Unicode::String 
- File::Basename 
- File::ReadBackwards 
- Scalar::Util 
- Scalar::Numeric 
- Statistics::Descriptive 
- Statistics::Distributions 
- Statistics::LSNoHistory 
- Statistics::RankCorrelation 



5. SET UP ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
===============================

The minumun version of Asiya requires the following system variables: 

         
ASIYA_HOME=/my/path/to/asiya/
export ASIYA_HOME
           
PATH=/my/path/to/asiya/bin:$PATH
export PATH

#WORDNET
export WNHOME=/path/to/wordnet-3.0
export WNDICT=/path/to/wordnet-3.0/dict
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/wordnet-3.0/bin


5. WHICH MEASURES CAN YOU CALCULATE WITH THIS VERSION?
=======================================================

In summary, you will be able to run the following measures: 

metrics_LEX = Ol  Rl Pl Fl
metrics_GTM = GTM-1 GTM-2 GTM-3 
metrics_BLEU = BLEU BLEU-1 BLEU-2 BLEU-3 BLEU-4 BLEUi-2 BLEUi-3 BLEUi-4 
metrics_NIST = NIST NIST-1 NIST-2 NIST-3 NIST-4 NIST-5 NISTi-2 NISTi-3 NISTi-4 NISTi-5 
metrics_ER = -WER -PER 
metrics_ROUGE = ROUGE-1 ROUGE-2 ROUGE-3 ROUGE-4 ROUGE-L ROUGE-S* ROUGE-SU* ROUGE-W 
metrics_L = LeM 
metrics_NGRAM = NGRAM-cosChar2ngrams NGRAM-cosChar3ngrams NGRAM-cosChar4ngrams NGRAM-cosChar5ngrams NGRAM-cosTok2ngrams NGRAM-cosTok3ngrams NGRAM-cosTok4ngrams NGRAM-cosTok5ngrams NGRAM-jacChar2ngrams NGRAM-jacChar3ngrams NGRAM-jacChar4ngrams NGRAM-jacChar5ngrams NGRAM-jacCognates NGRAM-jacTok2ngrams NGRAM-jacTok3ngrams NGRAM-jacTok4ngrams NGRAM-jacTok5ngrams NGRAM-lenratio 
metrics_TER = -TER -TERbase -TERp -TERp-A
metrics_METEOR = METEOR-ex METEOR-pa METEOR-st METEOR-sy  (when available for the target language)


Consult the technical manual for additional information about the metrics and their calculation.
