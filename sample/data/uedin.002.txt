 USA: The repetition is the mother of wisdom 
 It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of a man more intelligent, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, he took on the most stupid. 
 When it finally revealed his Afghan approach, waited anxiously, demonstrated that there is a copy of the script used in Iraq by Bush, established three years ago. 
 Not only in the same text uses a number of times the phrase “ just like in Iraq ", but did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's statement of January 2007 for his own statement:" A new way forward ". 
 It was he himself who three years ago, Bush criticized the idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering by civil war, and that criticized it as "an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences". 
 The following month, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on the recommendations of captains of area, was the only possible and successful, so that today we are not talking about Iraq in the news. 
 The reputation of Bush did not improve, however objectively left his successor an initial situation much more favourable than expected. 
 In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes to repeat the miracle.
