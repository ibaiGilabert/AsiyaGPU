 U.S.: Repetition is the mother of wisdom 
 It's funny that Barack Obama, President with the smartest man reputation as a diligent student repeats the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he mistook for the silliest. 
 When he finally revealed his approach Afghan eagerly awaited, it was shown that is a copy of the script used by Bush for Iraq, created three years ago. 
 Not only in the same text repeatedly uses the phrase "As in Iraq," but not hesitate to use the title of Bush's statement of January 2007 for his own statement: "A new way forward". 
 It was he himself who three years ago, Bush criticized the idea of sending military reinforcements to Iraq, the country suffering from civil war. And that criticized him as "an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences." 
 The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on recommendations from field captains, was the only possible and successful, so that today no one speaks nothing of Iraq on the news. 
 Bush's reputation was not improved, but objectively he left his successor an initial situation much more favorable than expected. 
 In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes to repeat the miracle.
