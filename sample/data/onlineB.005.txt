 Goldman Sachs faced criticism after paragraph almost 17,000 million (about CZK 300,000 million) for bonuses in the first three quarters this year. 
 The sum total of the bonuses in the state for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to outweigh, in spite of the move announced today, the 20,000 million. 
 High bonuses in the banking sector became, with the advent of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics. 
 Britain announced Wednesday it plans a one-time tax, a tax of fifty per cent, for banking bonuses in excess of 25,000 pounds (about CZK 712,000). 
 France is also preparing similar measures.
