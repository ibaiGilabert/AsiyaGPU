 The bank Goldman Sachs faced criticism after having almost $17 billion (almost 300 billion Czk) for the bonuses, in the first three quarters of this year. 
 The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the agency Reuters, probably exceed, despite the measure announced today, the $20 dollars. 
 The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, in a sensitive issue in politics. 
 Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax at once, with a tax of 50 per cent, the bonuses for exceed the 25,000 pounds (approximately 712,000 CZK). 
 France is also preparing similar measures.
