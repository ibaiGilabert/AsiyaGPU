 Lack of snow in mountains causes problems for hoteliers 
 It's not only Krkonoše ski-lift operators who are worried by these bare slopes. 
 The lack of snow is putting people off booking ski holidays in hotels and guest houses. 
 This means vacancies are still available in the Krkonoše throughout the winter, including Christmas and New Year's Eve. 
 We're getting plenty of visitors to our site. 
 People are browsing the offers, checking prices, but, so far, are worried about making a definite booking. 
 "When they call, the first thing they ask is if we think they'll see snow or mud," says Martin Jandura, who runs the Spindl.Info information web site. 
 Anyone who wants to spend New Year's Eve in Špindlerův Mlýn just how they want, had better start thinking about booking soon. 
 Those preferring to save money and go for cheaper accommodation can still give it a few days.
