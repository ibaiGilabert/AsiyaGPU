 The lack of snow in the mountains is concerned about the hotel 
 Not only the lifts in Krkonoše maintainers are concerned about the tracks without snow. 
 The lack of snow makes people not book stays in hotels and guesthouses ski. 
 That is why, in Krkonoše still are available free rooms for all winter dates, including for Christmas Eve and new year. 
 We have many visitors in our pages. 
 People look at the offers, check prices, but still afraid to reserve commitment. 
 "And if you call us, immediately ask about our opinion, if this Christmas snow or mud," mentioned the maintainer information portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura. 
 Those who want to spend in Špindlerův resort a new year according to expectations, not should doubt more setting aside the stay. 
 Those who prefer to save the money and put the quality of accommodation in second place, they can try waiting a few days.
