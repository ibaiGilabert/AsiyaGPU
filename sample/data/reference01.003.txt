 Managers at Goldman Sachs no longer to receive cash bonuses 
 The top management of the American bank Goldman Sachs will not receive their bonuses in cash this year. 
 The announcement came from the company as a reaction to the harsh criticism of their salary policies. 
 Instead of money, the group of 30 top managers will receive shares, which cannot be sold for another five years. 
 The shares can also be confiscated if the managers take excessive risks. 
 According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is leading the effort to link Wall Street bonuses with long-term performance. 
 I assume that Wall Street is well aware of the broader path it has to take, said former investment banker for JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
