 The repetition is the mother of wisdom 
 It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the man intelligent man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, he took on the most stupid. 
 When finally revealed his Afghan approach, looking forward, demonstrated that there is a copy of the script used to Iraq by Bush, established three years ago. 
 Not only in the same text uses used several times the phrase “ like in Iraq ", but did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's statement of January 2007 for his own statement:" a new way forward ". 
 It was he who three years ago criticized the idea of send new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering by the civil war, and that criticized it as "an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences". 
 The following month, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on the recommendations of captains of field, was the only possible and successful, so that today are not nothing about Iraq in the news. 
 The reputation of Bush did not improved, however objectively left his successor an initial situation much more favourable than expected. 
 In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes to repeat the miracle.
