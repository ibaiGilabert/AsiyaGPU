 EE.UU.: the repetition is the mother of the wisdom 
 It is true that Barack Obama, the President with the reputation of the man more intelligent, as a pupil diligent repeated in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, he took on the most stupid. 
 When we finally revealed its Afghan approach, waiting with bated breath, showed that it is a copy of the script used to Iraq by Bush, established three years ago. 
 Not only in the same text is used several times the "everyone as in Iraq," but not hesitated to use the title of Bush's statement of January 2007 for their own statement: "a new way forward '. 
 It was he who, three years criticized the idea of Bush's new military reinforcements sent to Iraq, the country is suffering by the civil war, and that is criticised as "an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences." 
 The following months, however, showed that the strategy of Bush, based on the recommendations of captains of field, was the only possible and successful, so that today we are not talking none of Iraq in the news. 
 The reputation of Bush does not improved, however objectively ceased to his successor an initial situation much more favourable than could have been expected. 
 In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects to retake the miracle.
